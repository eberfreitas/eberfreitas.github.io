    <h1>Braintest</h1>

    <p><small>21&#x2F;10&#x2F;2007</small></p>

    <p>Vi <a href="http://mindmedia.com/braintest.html">este teste</a> no blog do <a href="http://anderson.the-silvas.com/">Anderson</a> e resolvi fazer. Olha o meu resultado:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eber, you are somewhat left-hemisphere dominant and show a preference for
visual learning, although not extreme in either characteristic. You probably
tend to do most things in moderation, but not always. Your left-hemisphere
dominance implies that your learning style is organized and structured, detail
oriented and logical. Your visual preference, though, has you seeking
stimulation and multiple data. Such an outlook can overwhelm structure and
logic and create an almost continuous state of uncertainty and agitation. You
may well suffer a feeling of continually trying to &quot;catch up&quot; with yourself.
Your tendency to be organized and logical and attend to details is reasonably
well-established which should afford you success regardless of your chosen
field of endeavor. You can &quot;size up&quot; situations and take in information
rapidly. However, you must then subject that data to being classified and
organized which causes you to &quot;lose touch&quot; with the immediacy of the problem.
Your logical and methodical nature hamper you in this regard though in the
long run it may work to your advantage since you &quot;learn from experience&quot; and
can go through the process more rapidly on subsequent occasions. You remain
predominantly functional in your orientation and practical. Abstraction and
theory are secondary to application. In keeping with this, you focus on
details until they manifest themselves in a unique pattern and only then work
with the &quot;larger whole.&quot;  With regards to your career choices, you have a
mentality that would be good as a scientist, coach, athlete, design
consultant, or an engineering technician. You can &quot;see where you want to go&quot;
and even be able to &quot;tell yourself,&quot; but find that you are &quot;fighting yourself&quot;
at the darndest times.</p>
